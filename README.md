# Generated URLs
I generated a bunch of non taken URLs and put them in the `generated` folder.

- **Please note that this list is public and due to that some URLs have been taken**
- Also note that this list is being updated at some times to not include taken URLs
- I suggest you viewing them in `raw` due to the list contains quite many results
- [This](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) is the list I'm using to obtain all english words
